# Idea Composer Plugin

Adds code completion to composer.json file. This project is still under **heavy development** ;)

PhpStorm 8.0.2+ and 139+ version Intellij are supported, because in that version json language support is natively in
intellij sdk.

Code completion is based on composer.json schema, but there is also package names and version completion in require,
require-dev etc properties.
